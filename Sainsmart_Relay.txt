I seem to have bought these:

(From: http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/181026509345 )

It appears that the four-pin header with GND, IN1, IN2, VCC
is for receiving 3V3 or 5V signals from the arduino. Note
that logic is reversed -- high signal = relay on, low signal
= relay off.

The JD-VCC, VCC and GND pins on the other side are for
driving the actual relays. These want a moderately high current
5V line. Remove the jumper entirely, and apply power to the GND
and JD-VCC pins. (It sounds like the jumper is there for if you
have a 5V controller and don't care about optoisolation)

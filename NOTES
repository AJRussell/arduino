This package provides a makefile for building and uploading
programs from the command line:
aptitude install arduino-mk

See apps/Makefile for setup.

Note that I need to copy sketchbook/hardware/leostick info to
/usr/share/arduino/.../hardware though and add boards to boards
(see boards.txt here)

I had to add this to udev rules.d, in:
77-mm-usb-device-blacklist.rules

ATTRS{idVendor}=="20a0", ENV{ID_MM_DEVICE_IGNORE}="1"


For boardtypes, my Arduino with the USB Mini connector is type: nano328
The one I've soldered into the battery monitor is type: micro
